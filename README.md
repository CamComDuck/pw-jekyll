# English 231: Jekyll

*This is a page for professional writing students to explore [Jekyll](https://duckduckgo.com), a Markdown-based [static site generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator) that can be used with GitHub to publish documentation.*

## Introduction

This is a website built with [Jekyll](https://duckduckgo.com), a Markdown-based [static site generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator) that can be used in combination with GitHub and Markdown to web-based documents online. You can see the live site [here](https://rickwysocki.github.io/pw-jekyll/).

Jekyll is a common tool among technical writers due to its (relative) ease of use, extensibility, and writing-oriented features.

As we saw last week, GitHub and its associated project-management features can be used not just for software but also documentation projects. This activity will ask us to use these features to collaborative publish documentation on the major concepts we've been discussing this semester.

**Our goal will be to publish a series of reference pages that communicate key ideas from the course.**

## Steps

1. You will first reply to [an open issue](https://github.com/rickwysocki/pw-jekyll/issues/1) in our repository asking readers to brainstorm major topics from our class that would warrant a reference page. As you go, I will open new issues for each topic. We'll need at least one topic per person, but try to come up with a few.
2. Then, you'll go through the issues and assign yourself one to work on. I will show you how to do this in class.
3. Once you've assigned yourself a topic, you'll need to fork the repository (if you haven't done so already) and I'll show you how to create new pages on the site. 
4. You'll create the page (see the [Page Criteria](#page-criteria) checklist below). 
5. After we have the pages, we'll discuss the site and you'll add issues that you see to the GitHub repository.
6. The suggested revisions will be made, either by the relevant authors or by other folks looking at the documentation.

## Page Criteria

Each topic page should meet the following criteria:

- Be [topic-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic-based_authoring).
- Include two paragraphs of text.
- Offer three links where users can find more information.
- Display at least one representative image.

Remember to check the [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) documentation for formatting questions.
